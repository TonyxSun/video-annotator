Telephone the nation with technology I remember in my parents house in Chennai reading about the invention of the Kansas. Bella UPS initial invention helped found what became known as Silicon Valley and out of that game companies like fashion semiconductor and Intel and all the computers and software that we all used today you can draw a direct line from that didn't mention to the technology that powers your Twitter feed or your WeChat messages today
